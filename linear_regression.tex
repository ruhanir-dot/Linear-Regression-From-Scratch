\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to implement linear regression from scratch using Python and NumPy to understand the underlying mathematics and algorithms behind linear regression.
The importance of the project lies in its ability to provide a foundational understanding of linear regression as well as insights into how the algorithm works, including the concepts of cost functions, gradient descent, and model evaluation.


\subsection{Basics Of Linear Regression}
Regression is a method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or multiple independent variables. Linear regression is a specific type of regression analysis where we model the relationsip between the dependent variable and independent variable(s) as a linear function.
The main goal of linear regression is to determine the function of a best fit line that minimizes error. Error in this case is defined as difference between the predicted and actual value. Mathematically written as $ e = y - \hat{y}  $ where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value. Our function is defined as $ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_1 $ where $b_0$ is our y-intercept and $b_1$ is the slope.


Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
