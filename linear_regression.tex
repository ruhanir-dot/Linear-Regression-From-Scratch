\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to implement linear regression from scratch using Python and NumPy to understand the underlying mathematics and algorithms behind linear regression.
The importance of the project lies in its ability to provide a foundational understanding of linear regression as well as insights into how the algorithm works, including the concepts of cost functions, gradient descent, and model evaluation.


\subsection{Basic Concepts to Understand}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
